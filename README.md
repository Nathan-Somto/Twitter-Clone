# Fullstack Twitter Web Clone

</div>

A Fullstack Twitter web app clone built with the MERN stack and Next js as the full stack frame work.

## Reason For Project

I wanted to challenge myself and see how long it would take me to create and complete a full stack project. initially i wanted to use firebase as the backend but i felt that would have been a cheap and easy way out.
**Why I did not use the App router ?**
1. Most Next js codebases are still in the Page Router, so it pays to soildify your knowledge in the workings of the page router.

2. My laptop is too slow for the App router some how. if you really want this project to be in the App router here is a challenge for you rewrite the codebase.
